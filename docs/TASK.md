# Task Management

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 2024-12-19
- **Fix CORS redirect error for /tasks endpoint** 
  - **Issue**: Frontend requests to `/tasks` were being redirected to `/tasks/` causing CORS error
  - **Solution**: Added route decorators for both `/tasks` and `/tasks/` in backend
  - **Files modified**: `backend/routes/task.py`
  - **Result**: Frontend can now successfully call the tasks API without redirect errors
